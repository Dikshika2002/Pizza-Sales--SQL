# Pizza-Sales--SQL

In this SQL project, I analyzed a pizza sales dataset to answer key business questions. I utilized SQL to extract insights on total sales by category, customer order patterns, top-selling pizza types, and peak sales periods. By crafting efficient queries, I identified sales trends, evaluated customer behavior, and provided actionable recommendations to enhance operational decision-making.
